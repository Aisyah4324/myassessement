        My name is <b>Aisyah Raihanah Binti Yazid</b>, and I was born on July 13, 2004, in 
        <i>Selangor, Malaysia</i>. Growing up in this vibrant state has given me a strong sense of identity as a 
        <i>Malaysian</i>, along with an appreciation for our diverse 
        <font color="blue">culture and traditions</font>. From a young age, I developed a keen interest in technology, 
        arts, and culture, all of which have been central to my academic and personal journey.
        <br><br>
        I completed my primary and secondary education in <i>Malaysia</i>, 
        excelling particularly in mathematics and science, which fueled my curiosity about the world. 
        Currently, I am pursuing a <b>Diploma in Information Management</b> at <u>Universiti Teknologi MARA</u>. 
        This course has been transformative, as it covers a broad range of subjects, from libraries, archives, 
        and museums to coding, multimedia, and other areas within the field of Information Technology. 
        Each subject provides me with different skills and insights, equipping me to engage with both the technical and cultural
        aspects of managing information.

        Outside of my studies, I am passionate about exploring nature and video editing.
        I often spend my weekends hiking through nature trails, where I love to capture the beauty of the outdoors with my phone.
        The peacefulness of nature inspires me, and I take joy in editing these moments into small, memorable clips. 
        My interest in photography extends beyond nature, as I also enjoy taking random pictures throughout my day. 
        It is my dream to own a digital camera someday to elevate my photography skills and capture moments in greater detail.
        <br><br>
        <b>Family plays an important role in my life</b>.I cherish the time I spend taking care of my young niece and cousins,
        enjoying the laughter and joy they bring. I also have a deep compassion for animals, particularly cats,
        and often bring food to stray cats in my neighborhood. 
        This simple act of kindness brings me happiness and a sense of responsibility toward these innocent animals.
        <br><br>
        When it comes to food, I have a special love for <b>Tomyam and Ayam Gepuk</b>, which are my ultimate comfort foods. 
        Additionally, I find myself drawn to soft, pastel colors, which I believe reflect my personality calm, gentle, and adaptable.
        Looking ahead, title I aim to combine my knowledge in Information Management with my creative interests to build a fulfilling career. 
        I hope to one day use my skills to contribute positively to my community, while also exploring my creative passions further. In the meantime, 
        I remain focused on my studies and look forward to all the experiences that lie ahead.
        In conclusion, I am grateful for the journey that has shaped me thus far and am excited about the future. Whether it is through 
        my studies, creative projects, or acts of kindness, I aim to make a positive impact on those around me.</pre>
