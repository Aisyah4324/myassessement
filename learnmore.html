            My name is <strong>Aisyah Raihanah Binti Yazid</strong>, and I was born on July 13, 2004, in <em>Selangor, Malaysia</em>. 
            Growing up in this vibrant state has given me a strong sense of identity as a <em>Malaysian</em>, along with an appreciation for 
            our diverse <span style="color: blue;">culture and traditions</span>. From a young age, I developed a keen interest in technology, 
            arts, and culture, which have been central to my academic and personal journey.
        </h3>

                I completed my primary and secondary education in <em>Malaysia</em>, excelling particularly in mathematics and science, 
                which fueled my curiosity about the world. Here are some highlights of my educational achievements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieved excellent results in UPSR, excelling in Mathematics and Bahasa Malaysia.</li>
                <li>Obtained 3As and 6Bs in SPM, focusing on Business and Science subjects.</li>
                <li>Currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Management at <u>Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)</u>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <img src="images/image 1.jpg" class="bio-image float-right" alt="Gambar Aisyah">
        <p>
            Outside of my studies, I have several hobbies that I am deeply passionate about:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Exploring nature and hiking through scenic trails during weekends.</li>
            <li>Video editing and creating memorable clips of my adventures.</li>
            <li>Capturing random, creative photos with my phone, aspiring to own a digital camera.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>Family plays an important role in my life.</strong>
            Here are a few ways I cherish my time with loved ones and contribute to my community:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spending quality time with my niece and cousins, ensuring they feel loved and cared for.</li>
            <li>Feeding stray cats in my neighborhood, showing compassion and responsibility toward animals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When it comes to food, I have a special love for <strong>Tomyam and Ayam Gepuk</strong>, which are my ultimate comfort foods. 
            Additionally, I find myself drawn to soft, pastel colors, which I believe reflect my personalityâ€”calm, gentle, and adaptable. 
            Looking ahead, I aim to combine my knowledge in Information Management with my creative interests to build a fulfilling career. 
            I hope to positively contribute to my community while exploring my creative passions further. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, I am grateful for the journey that has shaped me thus far and am excited about the future. 
            Whether it is through my studies, creative projects, or acts of kindness, I aim to make a positive impact on those around me.
